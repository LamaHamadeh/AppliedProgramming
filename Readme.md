Python Applied Programming is a collection of learning material for an introductory Python course for undergraduate mechanical engineering students as taught at the University College London in the Mechanical Engineering Department.

Content:
--------
This element has four workshops each focuses on a specific topic. These topics are distributed through these workshops as follows:

Workshop 1: Pythons Basics, Scalars, Vectors, Matrices & Booleans ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Code/Pythons%20Basics%2C%20Scalars%2C%20Vectors%2C%20Matrices%20%26%20Booleans_W1.ipynb))

Workshop 2: Loops, Conditionals & Functions ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Code/Loops%2C%20Conditionals%20%26%20Functions_W2.ipynb))

Workshop 3: Working with Data ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Code/Working%20with%20Data_W3.ipynb))

Workshop 4: Data Visualisation ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Code/Data%20Visualisation_W4.ipynb))

The latest version of the delivered material can be found as a pdf file here: ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/Introduction_to_Python.pdf))

Datasets:
---------
The material uses two datasets:

1- ***Blood Data (as an Excell file*** ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/DataSets/BloodData.xls))

2- ***Movies (as a .csv file*** ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/DataSets/movies.csv))

The assessment uses a dataset collected from:

1- ***3D printed Stirling Engine (as a .csv file)*** ([Link](https://github.com/LamaHamadeh/AppliedProgramming/blob/main/DataSets/stirlingengineoutput1.csv))
